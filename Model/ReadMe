To run the script:
Steps:
For training the models:
1) Clone the github repo: git clone <github repo link> 
2) Go to the directory UNet-CON: cd UNet-CON
3) Create suitable conda/virtual environment for Python version=3.9
4) pip install -r requires.txt  # Install all the required dependencies or Or any pytorch container with "transformer" module will do the task.
5) Make sure to change the path where the input files will be taken 	#Paths were defined in “args.py” file
6) Change the path to save the weights and loss values #Paths were defined in the main_<model_number>.py
7) python main_<model_number>.py 	#Execute the main file


For testing:
Due to size limitations we didn’t upload model weights in Github. Instead Drive links are shared.
However, the same will be provided based on the user's request.
Steps for testing the model: 
1) Download the weight from the provided link
2) Change the path in the inference_3_2.py file (line no. 77) to the downloaded weights path 
3) Make sure to change the path where the test file will be taken
4) Run inference script: python inference_3_2.py
